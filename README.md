ðŸ‘¾ Bullet Blitz ðŸ‘¾

- This is a game when you use the mouse to move the turret around a fixed point. 
- You click the mouse to shoot. 
- If you hit asteroids, you get 10 points.
- If an asteroid reaches the turret, you die 1 time. 
- In order to win, you must get 1000 points and die less than 25 times.
- If you beat the game within 2 minutes, you get a score bonus.
- If you beat the game and hit a hidden item, you get another score bonus.

Most difficult challenges when creating this game:
- Calculating the best mathmatical equation to spawn enemies so it is smooth and not overly stressful
- Creating methods to calculate collisions between the turret and the asteroids

Overall, I really enjoyed this experience. What I loved so much about this was the creativity and freedom to do what I wanted; such as coming up with rules, audio, different objects, and the game itself. It was a challenge but rewarding experience, even more so that I can play it on my own machine.
