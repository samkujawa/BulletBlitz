ðŸ‘¾ Bullet Blitz ðŸ‘¾

This is a game when you use the mouse to move the turret around a fixed point. You click the mouse to shoot. If you hit asteroids, you get 10 points. If an asteroid reaches the turret, you die 1 time. In order to win, you must get 1000 points and die less than 25 times. If you beat the game within 2 minutes, you get a score bonus. If you beat the game and hit a hidden item, you get another score bonus.

Toughest challenges in creating this:
- Deciding the right mathmatical formula to move the enemies to ensure it was smooth and not overly complicated
- Detecting collisions from the turret with the enemies

Overall, this was a project I have never dipped my toes into. I really enjoyed the creativity aspect of this project like no other one I have completed. I loved the freedom to come up with my own objects, game rules, multipliers, and hidden objects.

Instructions for running:
- Download the code and run the GameFrame.java in an IDE
